## Foraging behavior responses of *Naso lituratus* to increased sediment exposure

This project uses data collected by myself at the Johansen Fish Resilience Lab loacted at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology throughout the period 9/12/24 - 9/22/25. The purpose of this project is to examine the  foraging behavior response of the fish browser species, *Naso lituratus* to exposure of different quantities of sediment in a lab setting made to simulate natural, sediment laden conditions.


## Data

All data is complied into one csv file named N_lituratus_forage.csv and be found within the [data folder](Data/N_lituratus_forage.csv).

Here is a table desceribing the data collected and used for my outputs within my document:

|    Data    |       Definition  |
|:-----------|:------------------------:|
| Fish_ID      | An assigned ID given to each individual fish       |
| Cohort      | An assigned number to group fish caught on the same day |
| Treatment   | The assigned treatment level of sediment used across trails, measured in mg/L |
| Experiment Type | The type of experimental trial each fish was put through |
| Total_length  | Total length of the fish from mouth to tail end, measured in cm |
| Standard length| Standarized length of the fish from mouth to caudal fin beggingin, measued in cm |
| Height      | Height of the fish measured from front base of dorsal fin to pelvic fin, measured in cm |
| Weight      | Total mass of the fish, measured in g |
| DB_Bites    | Number of bites taken from *Dictyosphaeria verslusii* sourced from runoff areas |
| CB_Bites    | Number of bites taken from *Dictyosphaeria verslusii* sourced far from runoff areas |
| DE_Bites    | Number of bites taken from *Euchema sp.* sourced from runoff areas |
| CE_Bites    | Number of bites taken from *Euchema sp.* sourced far from runofff areas|
| DB_Mass     | Mass consumed from *Dictyosphaeria verslusii* sourced from runoff areas |
| CB_Mass     | Mass consumed from *Dictyosphaeria verslusii* sourced far from runoff areas |
| DE_Mass     | Mass consumed from *Euchema sp.* sourced from runoff areas |
| CE_Mass     | Mass consumed from  *Euchema sp.* sourced far from runofff areas |
