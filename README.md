## Foraging behavior responses of *Naso lituratus* to increased sediment exposure

This project uses data collected by myself at the Johansen Fish Resilience Lab loacted at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology throughout the period 9/12/24 - 9/22/25. The purpose of this project is to examine the  foraging behaviorresponse of the fish browser species, *Naso lituratus* to exposure of different quantities of sediment in a lab setting made to simulate natural, sediment laden conditions.


## Data

All data is complied into one csv file named N_lituratus_forage.csv and be found within the [data folder](data/N_lituratus_forage.csv).

Here is a table desceribing the data collected and used for my outputs within my document:
